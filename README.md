Welcome to NU Fairview Hotel. Please choose among 5 options:

1. Check-in

2. Check-out

3. View Sales (in highest order)

- Upon checking in, a customer will choose 1 from 3 room types:

a. Single (1500.00)

b. Double (2500.00)

c. Suites (5000.00)

- Each room type consists of 10 rooms (constant)

- Single (Room #1, #2, #3 ... #10)

- Double (Room #11, #12, #13 .. #20)

- Suites (Room #21, #22, #23 .. #30)

- After choosing room types, the system should display available rooms and allow user to choose 1 from available room numbers

- After choosing room number, the system should display "You are about to check in to Room #1 Single. Your bill is 1500. Thank you!" -- this is when the user selects "Single" Room Type, #1 Room.

- When all rooms are occupied, display “Hotel is fully booked” when user chooses option 1.

- When a customer wants to check out, the system should allow the user to select Room Type first. After selecting the room type, display the occupied rooms and enter room number to checkout.

- Display Sales (option 3) in Room Type level. (e.g. Single 1200, Double 15000, Suites 30000)

- No customer can check in to an occupied room

- When a customer checks out, the room should turn from occupied to available

- Option 3 will display the accumulated sales sorted in highest order

- Option 4 will display the accumulated sales sorted in lowest order

- The program continues to display the four options until the user presses 5 (Exit)
